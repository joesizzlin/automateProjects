# automateProjects
A collection of my attempts of the practice projects from "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart

Here are the practice projects that I am working on from the book. 

Previously, I was sharing my completed projects as individual repos. 
Now, I decided that I am going to transition to share my collection of book projects under one repo.
I hope that this will help keep my collection simular python projects together while allowing me the opportunity to incorporate git branching and other features.

Pracice Projects will be found in their respective chapter numbers.

I plan to keep this repo public for community viewing and contributions.
